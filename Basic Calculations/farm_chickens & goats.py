# Program to input the number of heads and feet in a farm and identify the number of chickens and goats in the farm. For example, if there are 340 heads and 1,060 feet, there are 150 chickens and 190 goats.

h = int(input("no. of heads : "))
f = int(input("no. of feet : "))



x + y = h
2*x + 4*y = f


# f == 4*f + 2*f
# print(f)

# print("no of chickens in the farm : ",c)
# print("no of goats in the farm : ",d)



# goat : 4 feet_1head
# chicken : 2 feet_1head


# a = 3
# b = 10
